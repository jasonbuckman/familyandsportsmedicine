                        <h3>Our philosophy is that quality medical care involves a partnership between patients, their families, doctors, mid-level providers, and staff. We recognize continuity as an important aspect of your healthcare and will make every effort to schedule your appointment with your chosen doctor or clinician. Urgent problems, however, may require that we schedule you with the physician or clinician available in the office on that given day. After hours telephone calls transfer over to our answering service, which can reach the doctor on call for emergencies. The physician who returns your call after hours is a member of our call coverage group, which consists of family doctors in the local area. An on-call doctor is available every day including weekends and holidays to respond to emergencies. All our physicians are board certified.<br><br>The providers in our practice have privileges in newborn, pediatric, and adult medicine at Manchester Memorial Hospital, Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, St. Francis Hospital, and Hartford Hospital. Family physicians address the wide variety of health problems encountered by members of families of all sizes and compositions. Their training includes newborns, pediatrics, gynecology, adult medicine, psychiatry, orthopedics, sports medicine, dermatology, and office surgery. When necessary, specialists will be consulted to assist in the management of your health care needs. The practice utilizes the hospitalist’s program to provide inpatient care to our adult patients. We maintain hospital privileges and see all our own newborns at Manchester Memorial Hospital.</h3>
